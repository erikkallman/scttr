 *
 * In the global scope, root_inp provides an entry point for any function
 * to search the linked list of input nodes for a specific node,
 * corresponding to a specific input file read into the data stored in
 * and used by the program. In addition to basic datatypes, each input node
 * also contains @p metadata defined from the input, as well as a linked list
 * of spectra, derived from the screening and energy-range parameters
 * provided by the user.
