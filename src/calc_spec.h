/**
   * @brief This function uses the data contained in a given spectrum attached
   * to the @p inp provided as argument, and the @p trs variable to define a
   * matrix containing the calculated spectrum.
   *
   * To calculate the spectrum, stored in the @p s_mat variable of the spectrum
   * struct, the reduced Kramers-Heisenberg formula (M. Lundberg et. al. 2013)
   * is used.
   * Suitable functions are used to broaden the intensities summed in
   * each matrix element of the @p s_mat matrix.
   * Variables with either and @p _x or @p _y suffix refers to properties of
   * the excitiation and energy transfer axis respectively.
   *
   * @param inp the input node containing the data from which a spectrum matrix will be calculated
   * @returns EXIT_SUCCESS if successful, otherwise EXIT_FAILURE
   * @note side-effects: defines and initializes the following variables of a
   * spectrum struct: @p omega_x, @p omega_y, @p s_mat, @p sfac.
   * See the spectrum struct for more information.
   * @note the calculated spectrum matrix is not normalized in this function.
   * This is done in the write_spec() function.
